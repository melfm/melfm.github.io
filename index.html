* About

I'm a graduate student in the Department of Mechanical and Mechantronics at Univeristy of Waterloo supervised by Prof. Stven Waslander in the autonomous vehicle lab. 

I'm interesting in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, especially in Deep Learning. My current projects focus on vision for autonomous cars.
